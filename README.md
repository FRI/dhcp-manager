# FRI DHCP Manager

This app provides a UI for managing [ISC Kea](https://kea.isc.org/) host reservations to users in an Active Directory/LDAP organization.
It allows limiting editing of certain IP ranges to only a select group of users.

If you want Kea monitoring, make sure to check out [Stork](https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/stork)
